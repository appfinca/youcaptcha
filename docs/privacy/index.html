    <h1><a href="/"><strong>Hop</strong></a> Privacy Policy<br/><small>Last updated: January 01, 2016</small></h1>

    <p>
      <br/><strong>On January 01, 2016, we published a revised version of our Privacy Policy. Your continued use of Hop means you agree to this revised document, so please take a few minutes to read and understand it.</strong></p>

    <p>
      <br/>AppFinca Inc. (“we,” “us,” or “our”) respects the privacy of its users (“you” or “your”). This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect, how that information may be used, with whom it may be shared, and your choices about such uses
      and disclosures when you use the Hop mobile application, website, or any associated software that we provide for you (collectively, the “Service”). Unless otherwise defined, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our <a href="../terms">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

    <p>We encourage you to take a few minutes to read this Privacy Policy and understand it. By using our Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. If you have any question about our privacy practices, please
      refer to the end of this Privacy Policy for information on how to contact us.</p>

    <h2>What Information We Collect about You</h2>

    <p>We may collect information that can identify you ("Personal Information") and other information that does not identify you, as described below.</p>

    <ul class="no-dec">
      <li>
        <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
        <p>When using our Service, you will be asked to provide information including, but not limited to, your name, email address, phone number, contact list. We will also ask you to authorize the access to your certain Facebook account information, such
          as your friend list. If you chat with other users of our Service, you provide us with the content of your chats. If you contact us, you provide us with the content of that communication, and if you transact business with us, you provide us with
          the related financial information.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Log Data</h3>
        <p>We collect information that your browser or device sends whenever you visit our Service (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our
          Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, the type of mobile device and operating system you use, your mobile device’s unique device ID, the type of mobile Internet browser you use, your location
          information, and other statistics.</p>
        <p>In addition, we may use third-party services such as Google Analytics that collect, monitor and analyze this type of information in order to increase our Service’s functionality. These third-party service providers have their own privacy policies
          addressing how they use such information.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>We collect this information through our website, mobile application, or third-party partners by using the following technologies:</p>
    <ul class="no-dec">
      <li>
        <h3>Cookies and Pixel Tags</h3>
        <p>When you visit our Service, we may use cookies to facilitate access to our Service and to personalize your experience. A cookie is a bit of information that a website sends to your web browser to help the site remember information about you and
          your preferences. We also may embed pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear GIFs) on web pages, ads, and emails to measure the popularity of our features and services. Pixel tags are invisible graphics used to access cookies and track user
          activities (such as how many times a page is viewed).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Mobile Device IDs</h3>
        <p>If you use the Service through our mobile applications, we use mobile device IDs (i.e., the unique identifier assigned to a device by the manufacturer), or Advertising IDs (for iOS 6 and later), instead of cookies, to recognize you. We do this
          to store your preferences and track your use of our app. Data analytics companies also use device IDs to track information about the application usage.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>We may allow service providers, advertising companies and ad networks, and other third parties to display ads on our Service. These companies may use tracking technologies such as cookies (sometimes called DoubleClick cookies), web beacons, or mobile
      device IDs to collect information about users who view or interact with their ads.</p>

    <h2>How We Use the Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>We may use information that we collect about you to</p>

    <ul>
      <li>provide and improve our products and services, and manage our business;</li>

      <li>perform functions or services as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In all circumstances, we may perform these functions directly or use a third-party vendor to perform these functions on our behalf who will be obligated to use your Personal Information only to perform services for us. </p>

      <li>
        <h3>Other Users of Our Service</h3>

          person, and vice versa, to help you two become friends.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Service Providers</h3>
        <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services, and/or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used. These third parties have access

      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Advertising Partners</h3>
        <p>If we advertise, we or third-party

      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="no-dec">
      <li>
        <h3>Compliance with Laws</h3>
        <p>We do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement or to protect the security or integrity of our Service.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Enforcing Proper Use</h3>
        <p>We do so when we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud, or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety
          of our company, our users, our employees, or others; or to enforce our <a href="../terms">Terms of Service</a> or other agreements or policies.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Business Transaction</h3>
        <p>If AppFinca Inc. is involved in a merger, acquisition, asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy, your Personal Information may be transferred as a business asset. In such cases, we will provide notice before your Personal Information
          is transferred and/or becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>We also may share aggregated, non-personal information, or personal information in hashed, non-human readable form, with third parties, including advisors, advertisers, and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis or other
      business purposes.</p>

    <h2>How We Protect Your Personal Information</h2>

    <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, and we strive to implement and maintain reasonable, commercially acceptable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information we store, in order to protect
      it from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.
      <!--In paticular, passwords and credit card information are transmitted using the secure socket layer (SSL) and stored with AES-256 encryption. We follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional accepted industry standards to protect the information.-->However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and you should not expect the absolute security of your Personal Information.</p>

    <p>Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure channels such as email. Please refer to the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm"
        rel="nofollow">Federal Trade Commission’s website</a> for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.</p>

    <h2>Where Information Is Processed</h2>

    <p>Our information processing facilities are based in the United States. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information for us, please note that we transfer the information, including Personal Information, to the United
      States and process it there.</p>

    <p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that your information, including Personal Information, may be transferred to&mdash;and maintained on&mdash;computers located outside of
      your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction.</p>

        to completely remove the information (such as when the Content is jointly created by multiple users) and that there still may be unwanted effects (such as when others had already seen the Content). So we encourage you to exercise discretion and
        caution with respect to your Personal Information.</p>
