      special, or punitive damages, including, without limitation, loss of profits, loss of goodwill, damages for loss, corruption or breaches of data or programs, service interruptions, and procurement of substitute services, even if the Company has
      been advised of the possibility of such damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company’s liability to you for any cause whatsoever, and regardless of the form of the action, will at all times be limited to the amount

    <h2>Dispute Resolution and Governing Law</h2>

    <p>Many customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to a customer’s satisfaction by contacting our customer-care representatives at <a href="mailto:support@hop.appfinca.com">support@hop.appfinca.com</a>. So, please contact us first if you have any
      concern.</p>

    <p>This provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any dispute that may arise between you and the Company. The exclusive means of resolving dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any alleged breach
      thereof) or the Service shall be Binding Arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association. The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that you have the right to bring an individual claim against the Company in a small-claims
      court of competent jurisdiction. But whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any circumstances commence or maintain against the Company any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.
      <!--Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which persons with a dispute waive their rights to file a lawsuit, to proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead submit their disputes to a neutral third person (or arbitrator) for a binding decision.-->
    </p>

    <p>By using the Service in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration agreement. In doing so, you give up your right to go to court to assert or defend any claims between you and the Company (except for matters that may be taken to small-claims court).
      You also give up your right to participate in a class action or other class proceeding. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can grant
      any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court
      only for very limited reasons.
      <!--For details on the arbitration process, see our Arbitration Procedures.-->Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that this arbitration agreement is for any reason
      held to be unenforceable, any litigation against the Company (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in Sussex County, Delaware. You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those
      courts for such purposes. </p>

    <p>This Agreement, and any dispute between you and the Company, shall be governed by the laws of the state of Delaware without regard to principles of conflicts of law, provided that this arbitration agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration
      Act. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain
      in effect. This Agreement, with the <a href="../privacy">Privacy Policy</a> and any specific guidelines or rules that are separately posted for particular services or offers in the Service, constitute the entire agreement between you and the Company
      regarding the use of Service.</p>

    <h2>Indemnification</h2>

    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold the Company, its subsidiaries, and affiliates, and its and their officers, agents, partners, and employees, harmless from any loss, liability, claim, or demand, including reasonable attorney’s fees, made by any third-party
      due to or arising out of your breach of or failure to comply with this Agreement (including any breach of your representations and warranties contained herein), any postings or Content you post in the Service, and the violation of any law or regulation
      by you. The Company reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with the Company in connection therewith.</p>
